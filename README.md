### I’m an adult, but I like to sit at the kid’s table.

I’ve been building websites for over 20 years — the last 12 at Kajabi as a senior front-end engineer — and I still get excited every time a bit of code comes to life in the browser. I specialize in React, TypeScript, GSAP, and SCSS, though I’m comfortable with just about everything in the modern front-end toolbox. I love crafting interactive experiences that move, respond, and feel just right.

My style leans creative, fast, and clean. I’m a builder at heart — whether it’s pixel-perfect UI or a custom animation timeline. I thrive in remote environments, take ownership, and bring curiosity to every sprint. You can check out my latest work at benhays.dev.

But hey, I’m also a human. I’m married with two amazing kids (3 and 6), I’ve got a dog named Mo, and I still collect baseball and Lorcana cards. When I’m not coding, I’m probably gaming, watching YouTube videos about gem faceting or golf cart mods, or reminiscing about my days as Goofy at Disneyland (yes, really).

I’m looking for a remote-first team that values great UX and design, creative collaboration, and the kind of nerdy stuff that makes work feel less like… well, work.

#### Let’s build something cool.
