#### I’m a Creative Developer who believes the web should be fun again. After 12 years scaling Kajabi to millions of users, I’ve returned to my roots: building immersive, award-winning interactive experiences that make people go "Whoa. That's dope!"

I don’t just write code; I choreograph the DOM. I combine 20 years of engineering discipline (React, TS) with high-end motion graphics (WebGL, GSAP, Three.js) to build sites, games, and apps that feel alive.

My wheelhouse? I write the crazy, award-winning animations you want, but I architect them like a Senior Engineer so they never break.

Specialties:
• Motion: Complex GSAP Timelines, Framer Motion
• 3D/WebGL: Three.js, PixiJS, Canvas 
• Engineering: React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Next.js

Currently: Open for Creative Developer & Technologist roles.
Recent Work: Creative Technologist for Wildlife, Lead Creative Engineer at Kajabi.

Fun Fact: I’ve worked for Disney in two very different ways: once as a Cast Member (yes, I was literally Goofy at Disneyland), and later as a lead developer for their interactive campaigns. I bring that same vibe to every project.

#### Let’s build something cool.
